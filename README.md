# MIPS-Assembly

# Multiples:

MIPS Assembly program that takes three integers as inputs, and then outputs the number of multiples of the third integer
that lies in the range of the first two integers inclusive.
(E.g. A user input of 2 9 4 would cause the program to output 2.)

# NumDigits:

MIPS Assembly program that takes an integer as an input and outputs the number of digits of the input.
(E.g. A user input of 52 would cause the program to output 2.)

# InputChecker:

This program first stores all integers passed in by the user into an array (up to 100 ints) until a 0 is inputted. These integers are stored in order, and the user can then input any number and the corresponding array index of that integer will be printed if it is present, or -1 if not. Once 0 is inputted a second time, the program exits.
